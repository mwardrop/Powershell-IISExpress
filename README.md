Powershell IISExpress
=================

A function to run IIS Express from the current directory.

After running the script you can start IIS Express from any directory by typing `iisexpress`.

If you find yourself with the need to often run IIS Express I would recommend adding this function to your PowerShell profile so that it will be available immediately upon opening PowerShell.

`C:\Users\[User]\Docouments\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

If this file and / or folder does not exist just create it.
